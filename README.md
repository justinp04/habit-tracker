# Habit Tracker
This is my project building a habit tracker for myself and others to use as they please. This habit tracker uses a lot of the philosophy that James Clear has shown and detailed in his book 'Atomic Habits'.\
\
Even after reading Atomic Habits, I have still found that I lose my focus and consistency on these habits when too many random factors play into my life as university and balancing a job come into play, thus this investment of my time into making a web-application to help me track my habits will hold me accountable to use this. Similar to purchasing an important plane ticket to go into 'Deep Focus' which is a behavior Cal Newport has explained in his book 'Deep Focus'. By investing a lot into one thing with the sole purpose of completing work, people may be able t go into a state of heightened/deep focus to complete their work.\
\
There is a chance that this web-application may become a software product in the future, but for now, this README along with this repository will serve as a braindump and codebase for this habit tracker project.\

## User Interface
The desired end goal at the moment is to have a dashboard of sorts, allowing the user to see certain statistics that may motivate or provide a sense of wholeness to the user upon completing a task. The most important dashbaord features that I wish to include as of now are:
- Graph displaying their consistency (perhaps an exponential graph including their rate of improvement, improving by 1% everyday they complete their habit)
- Number of habits/tasks outstanding
- Days to remodel their habit to ensure their growth doesn't plateau
